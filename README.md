# How To Setup Your Game For DMI-CADE
Thank you for beeing interested in contributing your application to the DMI-CADE System!

This guide will help you setup your exported application for a seamless integration into the system.

## Game Adjustments
If you just start developing your game or if you're already done and want to set it up, either way there are some things you need to keep in mind and configure before exporting.

### Inputs
- Input Mapping: (WIP)
- Menu Navigation: If your game has a menu (e.g. for game mode selection or pausing) keep in mind that it must be controllable with the [available Inputs]() i.e. with keyboard inputs.
- Mouse Cursor: Since the DMI-CADE does not use mouse inputs but is build on Ubuntu, in the current systems version a pointer will be visible if your application does not hide it. It is recommended that your game hides the mouse cursor.

### Fullscreen
Your application must run in fullscreen mode when started.

### Export

Your game **must** be exported as a 64-bit executable program file for Linux (e.g. `My_Game.x86_64`).
For more information take a look at the [Export-Guide (WIP)](https://github.com/DMI-CADE/game-template/wiki/Export-Guide).

## Directory Setup
You can setup the directories yourself or download the [Game Template](https://github.com/DMI-CADE/game-template) and edit it.

### The Root Folder
The name of the root folder is used internally as an ID to handle your application. Rename the folder (`game-template`) to your apps title preferably **in kebab-case (dash-case)**.

E.g.: `my-awesome-game`

The folder contains at least three entries:

```
ðŸ“‚ my-awesome-game
 â”£ ðŸ“‚ PreviewMedia
 â”£ ðŸ“œ config.json
 â”£ ðŸŽ® My_Game.x86_64
 â”— ...
```

- `PreviewMedia`: Contains all the preview elements.
- `config.json`: Specifies how the system interacts with your application.
- `My_Game.x86_64`: The file required to run your app.

If your application needs additional files and/or directories to run (e.g. other files generated when exporting like `.pck` or the unity player) also drop them in here, next to your executable.

### Configure Your Application
The `config.json` file contains information on how your app is handled. Adjust the contents accordingly:

```json
{
    "type": "unity",
    "exe": "My_Game.x86_64"
    "buttonColors": {}
}
```
- `type`: The type of application. Available options: `unity`, `godot`, `executable`. If your game uses an engine or the like that is not listed, use `executable`.
- `exe`: The file name of the executable. This must be exact name of the file inside the root folder that runs the app.
- `buttonColors`: (WIP)

## Setup your preview

(WIP) (about `ðŸ“‚ PreviewMedia` contents)

### Configure Your Preview

The `preview_config.json` file configures how your preview is displayed in the UI.

```json
{
    "displayName": "The Apps Name",
    "gameFormats": ["1p", "coop"],

    "logo": "logo.png",

    "images": ["pic1.png", "pic2.jpg", "pic3.png"],
    "videos": ["trailer.webm"],

    "info1": ["Genre", "TheGenre"],
    "info2": ["Course", "TheCourse WS20/21"],
    "info3": ["Creators", "First Name, Second Name, Third Name"],
    "info4": ["", ""],

    "moreInfoText": "In this game you engage in an artificial conflict, defined by rules, that results in a quantifiable outcome.\n\nWe created it under these circumstances. This is how we came up with the idea.\n\nThis is more other cool information."
}
```

- `displayName`: The display name of the game.
- `gameFormats`: The play modes your game supports. <br> Available options: `vs`: Players can play against each other, `1p`: A player can play alone, `coop`: Players can cooperate with each other.
- `logo` (WIP)
- `images`: The exact file names of all preview images present. Try to use `.png` or `.jpg` formats. The images get displayed in the preview window as a dia show after any configured video(s) played.
- `videos`: The exact file name of all preview videos present in your preview folder. Note that the videos can only be displayed when exportet as `.webm` using the `VP8` compression format with `Vorbis` audio compression (even though the audio is muted when previewed in the UI). You can find a short guide on how to convert a video file to this format [here](https://github.com/DMI-CADE/game-template/wiki/Covert-Video-To-Displayable-Format).
- `info1` - `info4` (optional but recommended): String pairs containing short information about the game, displayed below the image/video preview. The first string of each pair is displayed on the left, as a descriptor. The second string is the information itself displayed next to it on the right.
<br>The  discriptor is shortened to 10 characters. (I.e. `Mylongdescriptor` becomes `Mylongdesc:`, `Creators` becomes `Creators:`)
<br>The actual information (i.e. the second strings) combined have 96 characters in total, but they break lines automatically. Every line is 16 characters long. So try to keep the information short.
<br> We recommend to use these fields to give information that is interesting to the players. Let them know from which context (e.g. course, lecture or game jam) the game comes. Give yourself credit as creators/developers by displaying your names or nicknames. Let them know in which semester the game was released/created.
<br>If you only need 2 or 3 info fields, leave the rest out or empty.
- `moreInfoText` (optional): More info text desplayed in the additional info panel. Put more information, background, instructions and credits here. Use `\n` for line breaks.
